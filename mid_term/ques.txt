Coal-fired power plants convert the chemical energy in coal to electrical energy through combustion. 

The efficiency of this conversion depends on various operational parameters, including the coal-to-air ratio, combustion temperature, steam pressure, 
and coal properties (sulphur content, water content). Optimizing these parameters can significantly improve plant efficiency and reduce operational costs.

**Part 1: Develop an Explicit Function of Efficiency**
- Use provided data of coal-to-air ratio, combustion temperature, steam pressure, coal properties, and corresponding efficiency.
- The relationship between efficiency and these variables is quadratic (as per Claude Sonnet 3.7).
- Implement:
    - Batch gradient descent
    - Mini-batch gradient descent
    - Mini-batch ADAM
- Visualize the objective function and solution path for all three methods.
- Explain the convergence behavior for different batch sizes in the two mini-batch algorithms.

**Part 2: Unconstrained Optimization Problem**
- Use the function derived in Part 1 to find optimal operational parameters.
- Allow the end user to choose any solution method from Part 1.
- Implement:
    - Newton with exact line search
    - BFGS
    - Conjugate gradient
- Visualize the objective function and solution path.
- Explain the convergence behavior.

**Note:** Be creative with visualizations to convey maximum information with minimum plots.
